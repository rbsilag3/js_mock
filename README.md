### Sharepoint notes
## 1. Deploy as a SharePoint Framework (SPFx) Web Part
Create an SPFx project that wraps your React application
Build the SPFx package (.sppkg file)
Upload to the App Catalog in your SharePoint tenant
Add the web part to your SharePoint pages
# This approach requires some restructuring of your code but provides the best integration with SharePoint.
## 2. Deploy to SharePoint Asset Library
For a simpler approach:
Take your build output (the build folder)
Upload all files to a document library in SharePoint (like "Site Assets")
Create a page with a "Content Editor" or "Script Editor" web part
Reference your index.html file in the web part
## 3. Use SharePoint's Site Pages
Upload your build files to a SharePoint library
Create a new Site Page
Add a "Script Editor" web part
Add code to load your application's JavaScript and CSS
## 4. Host in SharePoint's App Part
Host your React app on a separate web server
Create an App Part in SharePoint that loads your external application in an iframe
##Important Considerations
#Authentication: Your app will need to handle SharePoint authentication if it needs to access SharePoint data
#CORS: If hosted externally, you'll need to handle cross-origin resource sharing
#Relative Paths: Update your build configuration to use relative paths that work in SharePoint
#API Access: Use the SharePoint REST API or Microsoft Graph API for data access
